Dataset: 
An excel file containing dataset is provided along with the project.

EDA :
Histogram , countplot, pairplots and distplot are used for exploratory Data Analysis.Pairplot plots pairwise relationship between features of the dataset.Distplot shows the spread of the data and also shows the skewness present in totchol feature of the dataset.Countplot gives value count of people with or without heart disease.Histogram provides distribution of each feature with feature value on x-axis and frequency on y-axis.

Models:
I have scaled the features to between 0 to 1 before applying the model to get bettter results.I have used Logistic Regression Algorithm .

Results:
Accuracy on testing data  - 87.066%
