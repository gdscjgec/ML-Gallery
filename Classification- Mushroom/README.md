# Classification Models Applied On a mushroom dataset to classify mushrooms as edible or poisonous

# Dataset :

[Mushroom Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/mushroom-classification?select=mushrooms.csv) by UCL machine learning 

# Models: 

We use 7 different classifying models to classify a dataset. The given dataset has multiple categorical features. There are 23 features totally, we use the relevant features to classify mushrooms as poisonous or edible. 

The Project Uses 7 different Classification models, namely

1. Logistic Regression Classifier
2. KNN
3. SVM
4. Kernal SVM
5. Naive Bayes classifier
6. Decision Tree Classifier
7. Random Forest Classifier

# Results:

Here are the accuracy rates seen by implementing differet models 
  |Model              |Accuracy         |
  |:-----------------:|:---------------:|
  |Logistic Regression|95.71%           |
  |KNN                |97.74%           |
  |SVM                |98.83%           |
  |Kernal SVM         |100%             |
  |Naive Bayes        |92.14%           |
  |Decision tree      |100%             |  
  |Random Forest      |100%             |

# Test Accuracy For the Model

Test_acc = 1
  
  We get a 100 percent accuracy by Random Forest, Decision tree and Kernal SVM models
