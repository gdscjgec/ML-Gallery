# Sentiment analysis using Natural Language Processing Applied on restaurant reviews

# Dataset :

[Restaurant Reviews dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/apekshakom/sentiment-analysis-of-restaurant-reviews) 

# Models: 

We use 7 different classifying models to classify our reviwes. The given dataset has several restaurant reviews, both positive and negative. We use the stopwords dataset, a predefined dataset to filter our reviews. We then use NLP to filter our reviews and further use clssifying models to  

The Project Uses 7 different Classification models, namely

1. Logistic Regression Classifier
2. KNN
3. SVM
4. Kernal SVM
5. Naive Bayes classifier
6. Decision Tree Classifier
7. Random Forest Classifier

# Results:

Here are the accuracy rates seen by implementing differet models 
  |Model              |Test Accuracy    |
  |:-----------------:|:---------------:|
  |Logistic Regression|0.728            |
  |KNN                |0.496            |
