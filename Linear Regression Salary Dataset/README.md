# Predictive analysis of employees salary using Linear regression 

# Dataset :

[Salary Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/vihansp/salary-data) 

# Models: 

Upon Viewing the dataset, the Dependent variable and the independant variable seem to be related linearly. 
Hence we apply linear regression model to find the relation between the X and Y parameters

# Results:

# Test Accuracy For the Model

We can check the regression models accuracy using the R squared metric

The value of R squared metric is approximately 95 percent. This means our dependant and independant variable are highly correlated
